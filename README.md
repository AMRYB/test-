## Features

### UI Improvements
- Clean GPA/Grades summary layout:
  - **Left**: GPA + Term Marks
  - **Right**: CGPA + Cumulative Marks
- Terms are automatically sorted:
  - By year (2023, 2024, 2025…)
  - Inside each year: **FALL → SPRING → SUMMER**

### Accurate Calculations
- **UN31-Math0** is ignored completely:
  - Not included in GPA / CGPA
  - Not included in marks
  - Not included in credit hours
- **GPA (Term)** is calculated from the current term only.
- **CGPA (Cumulative)** handles repeated courses correctly:
  - If a course was taken multiple times, CGPA counts **only the highest attempt**
  - Older attempts are treated as if they don’t exist in CGPA

### Progress Tracking
- Registered Hours (Term)
- Passed Hours (Term)
- Completed Hours (Cumulative)
- Remaining Hours out of **138**

## How it works

- The extension injects a content script into the MyU dashboard page.
- It reads the grades/subjects table(s), normalizes the data, and:
  - Builds a clean summary UI
  - Calculates GPA for the selected term
  - Calculates CGPA cumulatively using the “best attempt” rule for repeated courses
  - Excludes UN31-Math0 everywhere
- It does **not** modify your grades or the backend — it’s UI + calculations only.
